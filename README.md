# My Travel Journey - Personal Website

Welcome to my first React project! This website is a personal showcase of my travels across the United States, highlighting the places I've visited, experiences I've had, and memories I've made along the way.

- **React** – for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Bootstrap** – for responsive and visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript & CSS** – for functionality and styling.
- **Problem-solving & debugging** – learning how to overcome challenges as a beginner developer.
